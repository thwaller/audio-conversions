# audio-conversions

## Purpose
I have been an audio enthusiest for as long as I can remember. Since my switch to Linux, I have tried to find quality audio tools, especially those that do conversions. Ideally this is lossless to lossy, but in some cases you need to convert lossy to lossy as well. Regardless of which you need to do, quality is absolutely key. I have tried many softwares for this purpose, but the problem is all of them have preset options and selections. This is simply no good except for basic users. To do proper conversions, a more complete control of the process is needed.
